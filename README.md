Basic info about Texas Intruments 16 bit PC the 99/4A.

I have created a DigiKey list using Cornell Dublier TTA series caps that you can find here: https://www.digikey.com/en/mylists/list/ICG882PJV5

The on radial cap on the power supply board is much shorter than the original, and can be mounted normally rather than on its side.
